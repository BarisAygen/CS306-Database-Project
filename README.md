# Database-Systems
This project is about a database which stores criminals and their information (prisons they stay in, their lawyers, visitors they have...). And all those entities have their attributes and relationships with each other.
You can insert, delete and filter the entities. Furthermore, the project has a support page in which you can communicate by messaging.
